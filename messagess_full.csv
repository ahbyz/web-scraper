Did some research, thought it might be a door latch issue, ordered a new door latch and replaced. Still did not work, had the same problem.

But sometime in early February this year, it started to produce dirty dishes, even if I turn on ""heavy load"". Our best guess was that the turning point was 2/4/23 when Boston got hit by the cold front. The water hammer arrester in the dishwasher line froze and leaked afterwards. We had a handy neighbor simply remove it and reconnect the line. In my reading of online articles it doesn't look like removing a water hammer arrester can affect the cleaning performance of the dishwasher, though it can make it louder (is this true?) So I'm wondering whether somehow there was an component(s) internal to the dishwasher that was damaged as well.

We are a young family with a toddler, so it's becoming unsustainable to have a dishwasher that doesn't work well.

Thank you,
John Liu

The dryer fits in the space, similar to the washer which was hooked up yesterday, but getting the vent attached and power cord connected is a little more complicated than just pushing it up against a wall, since it is fitting into a smaller space. 

We may need a longer power cord to reach the outlet, or to make one more hole in the interior wall.
